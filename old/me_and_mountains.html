			Hi, we're Me & Mountains. We're from Dayton, Ohio and have been playing music together for about two and a half years now. This is a download of our first EP recorded with Darryl Robbins at <a href="http://www.fictionbandmechanics.webs.com/" style="font-size:14px;">FictionBand Mechanics</a>. Please feel free to download and give it a good listen. And also, please keep this link super secret ;)
